# [Project 1: Credit Cad Fraud Detection: Project OverView](https://github.com/Himanshuk45/Himanshu_Portfolio/blob/main/CreditCard_FraudDetection.ipynb)
- Used python and machine learning algorithms to build a credit card fraud detection model. <br />
- Used matplotlib to create histograms and scatter plots to visualize the dataset. <br />
- Used seaborn to inspect the heatmap of the correlation matrix of the different variables. <br />
- Used three different algorithms to build the anomaly detection model: Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor & One Class Support Vector Machine. <br />
- Analyzed the result from all the three algorithms and concluded that Isolation Forest has an overall better accuracy score than the other two algorithms.
